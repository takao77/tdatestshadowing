A blessing in disguise
A chip on your shoulder
A dime a dozen
A leopard can't change its spots
A taste of your own medicine
Bark up the wrong tree
Beat a dead horse
Bite off more than you can chew
Bite the hand that feeds you
Blow off steam
Break the ice
Burn bridges
Burn the midnight oil
Bury the hatchet
Call it a day
Caught between a rock and a hard place
Cut corners
Cut to the chase
Devil's advocate
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't cry over spilled milk
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Elephant in the room
Every cloud has a silver lining
Flogging a dead horse
Get a second wind
Get out of hand
Get the ball rolling
Give the benefit of the doubt
Go back to the drawing board
Go down in flames
Hit the nail on the head
Hit the sack
Ignorance is bliss
It takes two to tango
Jump on the bandwagon
Keep one's chin up
Kill two birds with one stone
Last straw
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the cat out of the bag
Miss the boat
"No pain, no gain"
Once in a blue moon
On the ball
Open a can of worms
Piece of cake
Play devil's advocate
Pull yourself together
Put the cart before the horse
Rain on someone's parade
See eye to eye
Sit on the fence
Spill the beans
Steal someone's thunder
Take it with a grain of salt
Take the bull by the horns
The best of both worlds
The elephant in the room
The last straw
The whole nine yards
Throw in the towel
Under the weather
Up in the air
Wrap your head around something
You can't judge a book by its cover
Your guess is as good as mine
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A penny for your thoughts
Actions speak louder than words
Add insult to injury
All ears
All in the same boat
An arm and a leg
At the drop of a hat
Barking up the wrong tree
Beating around the bush
Bite the bullet
Break a leg
Break the bank
Burn the candle at both ends
Burn your bridges
Burst your bubble
By the skin of your teeth
Close but no cigar
Come rain or shine
Cry wolf
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut the mustard
Dig one's own grave
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't judge a book by its cover
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Every dog has its day
Face the music
Feather in your cap
Fight fire with fire
Finding your feet
Fish out of water
Fit as a fiddle
For the birds
Get a kick out of it
Get out of dodge
Get the short end of the stick
