A ballpark figure
A big fish in a small pond
A blessing in disguise
A tough cookie
Ahead of the curve
All hands on deck
Back to square one
Bark up the wrong tree
Behind the eight ball
Bite the bullet
Bite the dust
Blue sky thinking
Boil the ocean
Burning the candle at both ends
Burning the midnight oil
By the book
Call it a day
Call the shots
Can of worms
Change the game
Climb the corporate ladder
Close the deal
Come to the table
Crunch time
Cut corners
Cutting-edge
Do the heavy lifting
Dot the i's and cross the t's
Down the road
Drop the ball
Face the music
Fast track
Fight an uphill battle
Get a foot in the door
Get down to business
Get the ball rolling
Go back to the drawing board
Go the extra mile
Have a lot on one's plate
Hit the ground running
Hit the nail on the head
In a nutshell
In the black
In the driver's seat
In the loop
Keep one's eye on the ball
Learn the ropes
Let's get down to brass tacks
Let the cat out of the bag
Long shot
Make a long story short
Move the needle
My hands are tied
Nail it
No-brainer
On the back burner
On the same page
On the same wavelength
Out of the blue
Out of the loop
Out of the woods
Out on a limb
Outside the box
Pay through the nose
Pick up the slack
Play hardball
Pull the plug
Put all one's eggs in one basket
Put one's foot in one's mouth
Raise the bar
Read between the lines
Red tape
Reinvent the wheel
Rock the boat
Roll out the red carpet
Rule of thumb
See eye to eye
Sell like hotcakes
Sit on the fence
Smooth sailing
Spill the beans
Square peg in a round hole
Step up to the plate
Strike while the iron is hot
Take a back seat
Take the bull by the horns
Take the reins
Take with a grain of salt
Talk shop
Test the waters
The ball is in your court
The bottom line
The elephant in the room
Throw in the towel
Throw under the bus
Turn a blind eye
Under the radar
Up in the air
Wear many hats
Win-win situation
Word of mouth
Work out the kinks
Worth its weight in gold
Yes-man
